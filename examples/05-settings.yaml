  # shell: scripts defined in target.run.[].sh will execute in defined shell (default: sh)
  shell: bash

  # init: execute before each script. it will execute in the same shell process (default: empty)
  init: "set -ex"

  # shieldEnv: do not expose tame cli's environment's variables to targets
  # eg. `$ HELLO=world tame foo` -> variable HELLO will not be set in target foo (or any target) if shieldEnv is true
  shieldEnv: false

  # when maps are flattened and injected to a shell step as environment variable, the fields of the map are separated by the configured string
  # default: "_" (since "." does not work in sh only in bash)
